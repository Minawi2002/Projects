# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am an Electrical Engineering Master's student at ETH Zurich ðŸŽ“, with a focus on robotics and machine learning. My academic background and personal interests lie at the intersection of control systems, AI, and system automation, particularly in autonomous driving, and industrial robotics.

This repository showcases some of the computer vision tasks Iâ€™ve worked on during my own time, as well as an UNO game that I created with 5 teammates. These projects reflect my passion for developing intelligent systems and integrating cutting-edge technologies in control, automation, and gaming.

Feel free to explore the projects, and reach out if you have any questions or feedback! ðŸ’¬
