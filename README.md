I am an Electrical Engineering Master's student at ETH Zurich 🎓, with a focus on robotics 🤖 and machine learning 🧠. My academic background and personal interests lie at the intersection of control systems, AI, and system automation, particularly in autonomous driving 🚗, and industrial robotics.

This repository showcases a few of the projects I’ve worked on during my own time, where I explored various aspects of robotics, data analysis, and machine learning. 
These projects reflect my passion for developing intelligent systems ⚙️ and integrating cutting-edge technologies in control and automation.

Feel free to explore the projects, and reach out if you have any questions or feedback! 💬
